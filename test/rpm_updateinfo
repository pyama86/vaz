Description : Package updates are available for Amazon Linux AMI that fix the
            : following vulnerabilities: CVE-2016-6306:
            :         1377594:

            : reads Multiple out of bounds read flaws were found
            : in the way OpenSSL handled certain TLS/SSL
            : protocol handshake messages. A remote attacker
            : could possibly use these flaws to crash a TLS/SSL
            : server or client using OpenSSL.
            :
            : CVE-2016-6302:
            :         An integer underflow flaw leading to a
            :         buffer over-read was found in the way
            :         OpenSSL parsed TLS session tickets. A
            :         remote attacker could use this flaw to
            :         crash a TLS server using OpenSSL if it
            :         used SHA-512 as HMAC for session tickets.

            : CVE-2016-2183 SSL/TLS: Birthday attack against
            : 64-bit block ciphers (SWEET32) A flaw was found in
            : the DES/3DES cipher was used as part of the
            : TLS/SSL protocol. A man-in-the-middle attacker
            : could use this flaw to recover some plaintext data
            : by capturing large amounts of encrypted traffic
            : between TLS/SSL server and client if the
            : communication used a DES/3DES based ciphersuite.

            : was found in the Datagram TLS (DTLS) replay
            : protection implementation in OpenSSL. A remote
            : attacker could possibly use this flaw to make a
            : DTLS server using OpenSSL to reject further

            :         computing Digital Signature Algorithm
            :         (DSA) signatures. A local attacker could

            : vulnerabilities in codebase Multiple integer
            : overflow flaws were found in the way OpenSSL
